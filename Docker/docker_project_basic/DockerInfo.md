Certainly! Below is an elaboration of the entire process, covering how to set up a Docker environment, create a simple Python application, containerize it using Docker, and finally push the Docker image to Docker Hub.

### 1. Setting Up Docker

#### Install Docker
Docker can be installed on Ubuntu by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
```

#### Start Docker Service
Once Docker is installed, start the Docker service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

#### Verify the Installation
To verify that Docker is correctly installed and running, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command pulls a test image from Docker Hub and runs it. If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a "Hello from Docker!" message.

#### Enable Docker to Start on Boot
To ensure Docker starts automatically when the system boots, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

#### Logout and Restart
After adding Docker, it's a good idea to log out and restart your machine to ensure all changes take effect.

#### Check Docker Version
After restarting, check the Docker version to ensure it's correctly installed:

```bash
docker --version
```

This will output the Docker version currently installed on your system.

#### Add User to Docker Group
To avoid having to use `sudo` with every Docker command, add your user to the Docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

Replace `ubuntu` with your username if it's different. This command adds the user to the Docker group, allowing you to run Docker commands without `sudo`.

### 2. Python Application with Docker

Let's create a simple Python application and containerize it using Docker.

#### Python Application (`index.py`)
Hereâ€™s the Python script that defines a class `Print` and prints "hello world":

```python
# index.py
class Print():
    def __init__(self, str):
        self.str = str

    def PrintString(self):
        print(self.str)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    p = Print("hello world")
    p.PrintString()
```

#### Dockerfile
Next, create a `Dockerfile` to containerize this Python application. This file will be used to build the Docker image.

```Dockerfile
# Use the latest Ubuntu base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /docker/docker_basic_project/

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /docker/docker_basic_project/
COPY . /docker/docker_basic_project/

# Update the package manager and install Python 3 and pip
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Define the command to run the Python script
CMD ["python3", "index.py"]
```

### 3. Building and Running the Docker Container

#### Docker Build
To build the Docker image, navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and `index.py` file, and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t (Docker Username)/(My Repo):latest .
```

Replace `(Docker Username)` with your Docker Hub username and `(My Repo)` with the name of your repository. The `.` at the end tells Docker to use the current directory as the build context.

Example:

```bash
docker build -t abhishekf5/my-first-docker-image:latest .
```

#### View Docker Images
To see the Docker images that have been built on your system, run:

```bash
docker images
```

This command lists all the Docker images available locally.

#### Run the Docker Container
To run the Docker container based on the image you just built, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -it (Docker Username)/(My Repo)
```

Example:

```bash
docker run -it abhishekf5/my-first-docker-image
```

This command runs the container and executes the Python script, which should output:

```plaintext
hello world
```

### 4. Push Docker Image to Docker Hub

#### Docker Login
Log in to Docker Hub using the following command:

```bash
docker login
```

You'll be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password.

#### Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
Once you're logged in, you can push your Docker image to your Docker Hub repository:

```bash
docker push (Docker Username)/(My Repo):latest
```

Example:

```bash
docker push abhishekf5/my-first-docker-image:latest
```

This command uploads your Docker image to Docker Hub, where it can be accessed and pulled by others.

### Summary

1. **Installation and Setup:**
   - Install Docker, start the service, verify installation, and set Docker to start on boot.
   - Add your user to the Docker group for easier access.

2. **Create a Python Application:**
   - Write a simple Python script (`index.py`) that prints "hello world".

3. **Containerize the Application:**
   - Create a `Dockerfile` that specifies the base image, sets the working directory, copies the application, installs dependencies, and runs the script.

4. **Build and Run:**
   - Build the Docker image using `docker build`, then run it with `docker run`.

5. **Push to Docker Hub:**
   - After logging in to Docker Hub, push your image using `docker push`.

This entire process sets up a Dockerized Python application, allowing you to share and deploy it easily using Docker.
