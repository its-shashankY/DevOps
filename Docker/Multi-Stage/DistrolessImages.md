### Content for Distroless Images and Running & Connecting Multiple Containers

#### **1. Introduction to Distroless Images**
Distroless images are minimal Docker images that contain only the essential application and its runtime dependencies, omitting the OS-level packages. This approach significantly reduces the image size and attack surface, making your containers more secure and efficient.

- **Advantages:**
  - **Smaller Size:** Distroless images are much smaller than traditional images, which speeds up deployment times.
  - **Improved Security:** With fewer packages, the attack surface is reduced, and there are fewer vulnerabilities to exploit.
  - **Better Performance:** The lightweight nature of these images can lead to better resource utilization and performance.

#### **2. Creating a Distroless Image**
To create a Distroless image, you start by writing a Dockerfile that uses a Distroless base image. Here’s an example of how to create a Python application using a Distroless image:

Refer Dockerfile

This Dockerfile first builds the application in a standard Python environment and then copies the necessary files to a Distroless image for the final build.

#### **3. Running Multiple Containers: Frontend and Backend**
In most applications, you’ll need to run multiple containers, such as a frontend (e.g., React) and a backend (e.g., Node.js or Python Flask).

##### **3.1 Setting Up the Backend Container**
Here's an example Dockerfile for a simple Node.js backend:

Refer the DockerFile

##### **3.2 Setting Up the Frontend Container**
Here's an example Dockerfile for a React frontend:

Refer the Dockerfile

#### **4. Connecting Frontend and Backend Containers**
To connect these containers, you can use Docker Compose or Kubernetes. Below is an example using Docker Compose.

Refer Docker Compose YAML

This configuration sets up two services: `frontend` and `backend`. The `depends_on` keyword ensures that the backend service starts before the frontend. Both services will be accessible on their respective ports.

#### **5. Running the Containers**
To start your application, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the images and start the containers, connecting the frontend and backend. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, and it will communicate with the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.

#### **6. Conclusion**
Distroless images offer a lightweight and secure way to deploy your applications. By running multiple containers for frontend and backend services and connecting them, you can create a robust microservices architecture that is efficient, secure, and easy to manage.
