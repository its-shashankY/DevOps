The `Dockerfile` provided above assumes that your Django project files are in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`. The Django project files should include:

1. **Project Files**: These are the Python files and directories that make up your Django project, such as:
   - `manage.py`: The command-line utility for administrative tasks in Django.
   - Project directory (e.g., `myproject/`): Contains settings, URLs, WSGI, ASGI, and other configuration files.
   - App directories (e.g., `app1/`, `app2/`): Contains models, views, templates, and other components for each app in your Django project.
   - `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required by your Django project.

### Example of a Django Project Structure

Your directory structure should look something like this:

```
/path/to/your/project/
│
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
├── manage.py
├── myproject/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   ├── wsgi.py
│   └── asgi.py
└── myapp/
    ├── migrations/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── tests.py
    └── views.py
```

### Explanation of Each File/Directory

- **Dockerfile**: Defines how the Docker image for your Django application is built.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains a list of Python packages that your Django application depends on, which are installed inside the Docker container.
- **manage.py**: The command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project.
- **myproject/**: The main project directory, typically named after your project.
  - `settings.py`: Contains settings/configuration for your Django project.
  - `urls.py`: Defines the URL routes for your Django project.
  - `wsgi.py` and `asgi.py`: Entry points for WSGI and ASGI compatible web servers to serve your project.
- **myapp/**: A Django app within your project, containing models, views, migrations, etc.

### Building and Running the Docker Image

1. Place the `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your Django project, alongside `manage.py` and `requirements.txt`.
2. SSH into your EC2 instance.
3. Navigate to your Django project directory and run the Docker build and run commands as mentioned previously.

This setup will allow Docker to include all necessary files in the container, enabling the Django application to run successfully inside the container.
